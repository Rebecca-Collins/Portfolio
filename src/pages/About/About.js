            As a software engineer and a lifelong learner, I am driven by my
            passion for coding and creating visually stunning and intuitive
            websites. Growing up, I was always fascinated by magic and I feel
            the same way about coding. After seeing how challenging it was for
            my family's small business to succeed, I decided to pursue my dream
            and started my career as a web developer.

            teamwork skills, I am determined to see each project through from
            start to finish. My background in construction and people-related
            environments has honed my problem-solving skills, and I bring that
            same determination to each project I undertake.
